# Project 1 : Marketing-analysis
This project analyzes youtube data to identify the most influential Youtubers, helping users select the best influencers for targeted marketing campaigns in the US.
# Objective
*What is the key issue?*
\
\
The Head of Marketing wants to find out who the top YouTubers are in 2024 to decide on which YouTubers would be best to run marketing campaigns throughout the rest of the year.

*What is the ideal solution?*
\
\
Create a dashboard that provides insights into the top US YouTubers in 2024, including their :

- subscriber count
- total views
- total videos
- engagement metrics
  
Those key elements will help the marketing team make informed decisions about which YouTubers to collaborate with for their marketing campaigns.

# User Expectation
As the Head of Marketing, I would like to use a dashboard that analyses YouTube channel data in the US .

This dashboard should allow me to identify the top performing channels based on metrics like subscriber base and average views.

With this information, I can make more informed decisions about which Youtubers are right to collaborate with, and therefore maximize how effective each marketing campaign is.
